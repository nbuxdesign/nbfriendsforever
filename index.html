At the end of the day, I want my work to feel both purposeful and genuinely enjoyable to use.

            <p>By iterating early, testing with users, and refining continuously, I think any project is capable of hitting the sweet spot between the user’s delight and business results. Ultimately, it’s about making design decisions that move the needle in a meaningful way.</p>
