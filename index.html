      <h2>
        Bleacher Report was facing a classic legacy-startup issue: The product
        and backend that powers it were aging
      </h2>
      <p>
        BR has been a wildcard in sports news, competing with ESPN and CBS.
        Following their acquisition by Turner/Warner Brothers, they now reach 53
        million monthly users. Despite their success, they faced significant
        tech debt and a shift toward video-heavy news consumption, all while
        needing to maintain their earned authenticity in the sports community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined early in the 2.0 redesign to help a small design team establish
        processes, develop scope, and pitch concepts for a video-enabled news
        platform with social features, allowing users to contribute directly. As
        the project progressed, I played a key role in designing and delivering
        key features across web and app products, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Process Development &amp; Scope Definition</b><br />
          First thingâ€™s first, what are we making and how are we going to make
          it? We consulted stakeholders and department leaders to establish
          goals, develop a scope and create a pipeline that guides ideas through
          multiple levels of review and approval.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>UX Research &amp; Product Vision</b><br />
          With so many users it was imperative that we understood our usersâ€™
          habits and developed an accurate portrait of the experience they
          needed. We engaged in deep analytic research and testing across the
          company to develop a product vision that the company could believe
          in.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Stadium Design System</b><br />
          Stadium is an advanced design system built in Figma that allowed for
          the standardization of components in a fully responsive environment
          across device types. This system was integrated by the engineering
          teams and fostered seamless collaboration between design, product and
          engineering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interface Design &amp; Art Direction</b><br />
          BR is a brand that seeks to exist at the forefront of sport culture
          and has a brand that feels different than any legacy media brand. I
          worked closely with the art direction team to translate a fresh
          overhaul of the BR brand to 2.0 and deliver technical documents to
          engineering teams.

      <h2>
        I team up with stakeholders, product managers, and developers to shape a
        clear strategy right from the start. Iâ€™m big on open communication,
        experimenting early, and iterating until weâ€™ve nailed an experience that
        just clicks. At the end of the day, I want my work to feel both
        purposeful and genuinely enjoyable to use.
      </h2>
      <p>
        By iterating early, testing with users, and refining continuously, I
        think any project is capable of hitting the sweet spot between the
        userâ€™s delight and business results. Ultimately, itâ€™s about making
        design decisions that move the needle in a meaningful way.
