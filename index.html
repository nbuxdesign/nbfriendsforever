      <h2>
        Bleacher Report was facing a classic legacy-startup issue: The product
        and backend that powers it were aging
      </h2>
      <p>
        BR has been a wildcard in sports news, competing with ESPN and CBS.
        Following their acquisition by Turner/Warner Brothers, they now reach 53
        million monthly users. Despite their success, they faced significant
        tech debt and a shift toward video-heavy news consumption, all while
        needing to maintain their earned authenticity in the sports community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined early in the 2.0 redesign to help a small design team establish
        processes, develop scope, and pitch concepts for a video-enabled news
        platform with social features, allowing users to contribute directly. As
        the project progressed, I played a key role in designing and delivering
        key features across web and app products, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Process Development &amp; Scope Definition</b><br />
          First thing‚Äôs first, what are we making and how are we going to make
          it? We consulted stakeholders and department leaders to establish
          goals, develop a scope and create a pipeline that guides ideas through
          multiple levels of review and approval.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Stadium Design System</b><br />
          Stadium is an advanced design system built in Figma that allowed for
          the standardization of components in a fully responsive environment
          across device types. This system was integrated by the engineering
          teams and fostered seamless collaboration between design, product and
          engineering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interface Design &amp; Art Direction</b><br />
          BR is a brand that seeks to exist at the forefront of sport culture
          and has a brand that feels different than any legacy media brand. I
          worked closely with the art direction team to translate a fresh
          overhaul of the BR brand to 2.0 and deliver technical documents to
          engineering teams.

      <h2>
        I team up with stakeholders, product managers, and developers to shape a
        clear strategy right from the start. I‚Äôm big on open communication,
        experimenting early, and iterating until we‚Äôve nailed an experience that

        By iterating early, testing with users, and refining continuously, I

      <h2>
		Experience Design for Smart Speakers present an interesting challenge; How can you accurately map an experience when the input method is language?
      </h2>
      <p>
		We typically see interacting with digital products as a series of very basic interactions - Taps, drags and clicks are relatively binary commands that effectively propel users forward toward a goal. However, in english alone, there are so many different ways to say the same thing that traditional UX documentation didn‚Äôt feel capable of painting a full picture of how the app would work
		</p><p>	
		Instead we had to adopt a new and way of thinking about interactions and map it across a series of intents, utterances and follow-ups. Intents are easy to understand as a users end goal and follow-ups act as input fields that a device may ask you to clarify in order to complete an intent but utterances reveal a blind spot. 
		</p><p>
		An utterance is the type of phrase a user employs to reach their intent. For example, one user could say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the score of Duke‚Äôs last game?‚Äù another ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the Duke score?‚Äù or they may say ‚ÄúWhat are the scores from last night‚Äù - Each of these are different ways of accessing the same information and It‚Äôs important to understand how people ask for things without knowing exactly what they will say.
		</p><p>
		The best approach we found for covering a wide array of utterances was writing comprehensive scripts that cover each type of information our app was capable of providing. Scripts are exactly as they sound and map utterances against user profiles and their intents.
      </p>

        <li>
          <b>UX Research &amp; Product Vision</b><br />
          With so many users it was imperative that we understood our users‚Äô
          habits and developed an accurate portrait of the experience they
          needed. We engaged in deep analytic research and testing across the
          company to develop a product vision that the company could believe
          in.
